This is technically first post in this blog. I thought it's worth to write down the process of creating this static website.

I choose to use English as the language in this blog, which might be helpful in future. Or I may switch to Chinese anyway. 

## Steps

1. Searched a little bit in zhihu.com and found this post about [create website using huge](https://blog.coderzh.com/2015/08/29/hugo/)
1. quick start with hugo: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/
1. and hosting on github: https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/

It's quite simple to create a simple page, but there sohuld be more features to add later. Let's see if there's any needed, and add them then.
